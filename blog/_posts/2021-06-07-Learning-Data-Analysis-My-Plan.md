After a long period of job searching for a job without any success and getting burnt out, I decided to focus on picking up some new skills. I looked towards data analysis as some of the skills overlapped with what I had already learned as a student. So I began researching on the essential skills that a data analyst should have. 

And the skills I've found are:

- Python/R Programming 
    - Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy (for Python)
- Statistics (Descriptive statistics focus)
    - Probability, regression, inference, modeling, A/B testing, significance testing, ANOVA, forecasting, etc.
- Working with data
    - Data collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis (of course)
- Visualization
    - Tableau, PowerBI, dashboarding
- Working with databases
    - SQL, ETL
- Excel
    - Pivot tables, VBA


With some "nice to haves" being:
- Machine learning
<!--more-->
    - Orange, Tensorflow, neural networks, deep learning
- Advanced database management 
    - MongoDB or cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Version control
    - Github
- Web development 
    - D3.js, Chart.js, Bootstrap
- Big data
    - Apache Spark & Hadoop

It's quite a list of things to learn and certainly not an exhaustive list of skills that might be useful. My goal is to chip down this list over the course of a month or two, starting with statistics. I've taken several math and econ courses with some touching upon statistics-related topics. However, I've only taken only one dedicated statistics course in university which was an introductory course. From what it seems, statistics is the core of data analysis so I think it's best to start here.

Looking for online courses for statistics and R, I found a [HarvardX Data Science course](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) as a recommended place to start. It will teach me how to work with R while covering foundational statistics topics. Plus it's also completely free as long as I don't care about receiving an official certificate. At the time of writing this, I've already completed the R Basics section and plan to write a summary of it soon.
