After a long period of job searching for a job without any success and getting burnt out, I decided to focus on picking up some new skills. I looked towards data analysis as some of the skills overlapped with what I had already learned as a student. So I began researching on the essential skills that a data analyst should have. Maybe I won't start off as a data analyst, but it seems a lot of these skills are used in other tech-related roles so the learning will still be useful.

The skills I've found in my search are:

- Python/R Programming 
    - Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy (for Python)
- Statistics (Descriptive statistics focus)
    - Probability, regression, inference, modeling, A/B testing, significance testing, ANOVA, forecasting, etc.
- Working with data
    - Data collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis (of course)
- Visualization
    - Tableau, PowerBI, dashboarding
- Working with databases
    - SQL, ETL
- Excel
    - Pivot tables, VBA


With some "nice to haves" being:
- Machine learning
<!--more-->
    - Orange, Tensorflow, neural networks, deep learning
- Advanced database management 
    - MongoDB or cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Version control
    - Github
- Web development 
    - D3.js, Chart.js, Bootstrap
- Big data
    - Apache Spark & Hadoop

It's quite a list of things to learn and certainly not an exhaustive list of skills that might be useful. I looked around for a place to start learning and found a [Data Analyst program](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/ibm-data-analyst) by IBM. It will introduce various common tools that data analysts use and teach me how to use them. Hopefully it turns out to be a good course. Luckily, it is also completely free as long as I don't want an official certificate.
