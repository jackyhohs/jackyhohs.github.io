In the next part of the program, it goes over performing data analysis using Python. In particular, it focuses on the NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Seaborn packages and how to apply them.
The main topics covered for Python were:
- Importing data from files.
- Working with Pandas data frames 
- Data Wrangling
    - How to deal with missing data
    - Formatting data to be consistent within columns
    - Data normalization
- Creating box plots and heatmaps

Then it gets into statistics topics such as developing a model using linear regression and evaluating how well it fits. Since it isn't a statistics course, it didn't exactly go in-depth with statistics. It mostly just introduced the concept, gave a summary of what it is, and how to apply it. These do seem like more advanced topics though, I'll probably have to read more about some of them if I end up having to use them.

The exercises for this section are in the form of a hands-on lab. It opens up a website which sets up an environment similar to Jupyter Lab. So it was easy to read along the instructions while being able to test out Python code.

Next I will be trying to learn SQL. While the program mentioned does have a section on SQL, I think learning SQL can be helpful in general, not just in data analysis. So I looked to other sources for SQL tutorials. I found the [tutorial by Mode](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/) to be recommended. Since I've worked with SQL before too, I'll skim over the basics and continue from there.
